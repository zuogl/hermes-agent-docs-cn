# Matrix Setup

Hermes Agent integrates with Matrix, the open, federated messaging protocol. Matrix lets you run your own homeserver or use a public one like matrix.org — either way, you keep control of your communications. The bot connects via the `matrix-nio` Python SDK, processes messages through the Hermes Agent pipeline (including tool use, memory, and reasoning), and responds in real time. It supports text, file attachments, images, audio, video, and optional end-to-end encryption (E2EE).

Hermes works with any Matrix homeserver — Synapse, Conduit, Dendrite, or matrix.org.

Before setup, here's the part most people want to know: how Hermes behaves once it's connected.

## How Hermes Behaves

| Context | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **DMs** | Hermes responds to every message. No `@mention` needed. Each DM has its own session. |
| **Rooms** | By default, Hermes requires an `@mention` to respond. Set `MATRIX_REQUIRE_MENTION=false` or add room IDs to `MATRIX_FREE_RESPONSE_ROOMS` for free-response rooms. Room invites are auto-accepted. |
| **Threads** | Hermes supports Matrix threads (MSC3440). If you reply in a thread, Hermes keeps the thread context isolated from the main room timeline. Threads where the bot has already participated do not require a mention. |
| **Auto-threading** | By default, Hermes auto-creates a thread for each message it responds to in a room. This keeps conversations isolated. Set `MATRIX_AUTO_THREAD=false` to disable. |
| **Shared rooms with multiple users** | By default, Hermes isolates session history per user inside the room. Two people talking in the same room do not share one transcript unless you explicitly disable that. |

:::tip
The bot automatically joins rooms when invited. Just invite the bot's Matrix user to any room and it will join and start responding.
:::

### Session Model in Matrix

By default:

- each DM gets its own session
- each thread gets its own session namespace
- each user in a shared room gets their own session inside that room

This is controlled by `config.yaml`:

```yaml
group_sessions_per_user: true
```

Set it to `false` only if you explicitly want one shared conversation for the entire room:

```yaml
group_sessions_per_user: false
```

Shared sessions can be useful for a collaborative room, but they also mean:

- users share context growth and token costs
- one person's long tool-heavy task can bloat everyone else's context
- one person's in-flight run can interrupt another person's follow-up in the same room

### Mention and Threading Configuration

You can configure mention and auto-threading behavior via environment variables or `config.yaml`:

```yaml
matrix:
  require_mention: true           # Require @mention in rooms (default: true)
  free_response_rooms:            # Rooms exempt from mention requirement
    - "!abc123:matrix.org"
  auto_thread: true               # Auto-create threads for responses (default: true)
```

Or via environment variables:

```bash
MATRIX_REQUIRE_MENTION=true
MATRIX_FREE_RESPONSE_ROOMS=!abc123:matrix.org,!def456:matrix.org
MATRIX_AUTO_THREAD=true
```

:::note
If you are upgrading from a version that did not have `MATRIX_REQUIRE_MENTION`, the bot previously responded to all messages in rooms. To preserve that behavior, set `MATRIX_REQUIRE_MENTION=false`.
:::

This guide walks you through the full setup process — from creating your bot account to sending your first message.

## Step 1: Create a Bot Account

You need a Matrix user account for the bot. There are several ways to do this:

### Option A: Register on Your Homeserver (Recommended)

If you run your own homeserver (Synapse, Conduit, Dendrite):

1. Use the admin API or registration tool to create a new user:

```bash
# Synapse example
register_new_matrix_user -c /etc/synapse/homeserver.yaml http://localhost:8008
```

2. Choose a username like `hermes` — the full user ID will be `@hermes:your-server.org`.

### Option B: Use matrix.org or Another Public Homeserver

1. Go to [Element Web](https://app.element.io) and create a new account.
2. Pick a username for your bot (e.g., `hermes-bot`).

### Option C: Use Your Own Account

You can also run Hermes as your own user. This means the bot posts as you — useful for personal assistants.

## Step 2: Get an Access Token

Hermes needs an access token to authenticate with the homeserver. You have two options:

### Option A: Access Token (Recommended)

The most reliable way to get a token:

**Via Element:**
1. Log in to [Element](https://app.element.io) with the bot account.
2. Go to **Settings** → **Help & About**.
3. Scroll down and expand **Advanced** — the access token is displayed there.
4. **Copy it immediately.**

**Via the API:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-server/_matrix/client/v3/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "m.login.password",
    "user": "@hermes:your-server.org",
    "password": "your-password"
  }'
```

The response includes an `access_token` field — copy it.

:::warning[Keep your access token safe]
The access token gives full access to the bot's Matrix account. Never share it publicly or commit it to Git. If compromised, revoke it by logging out all sessions for that user.
:::

### Option B: Password Login

Instead of providing an access token, you can give Hermes the bot's user ID and password. Hermes will log in automatically on startup. This is simpler but means the password is stored in your `.env` file.

```bash
MATRIX_USER_ID=@hermes:your-server.org
MATRIX_PASSWORD=your-password
```

## Step 3: Find Your Matrix User ID

Hermes Agent uses your Matrix User ID to control who can interact with the bot. Matrix User IDs follow the format `@username:server`.

To find yours:

1. Open [Element](https://app.element.io) (or your preferred Matrix client).
2. Click your avatar → **Settings**.
3. Your User ID is displayed at the top of the profile (e.g., `@alice:matrix.org`).

:::tip
Matrix User IDs always start with `@` and contain a `:` followed by the server name. For example: `@alice:matrix.org`, `@bob:your-server.com`.
:::

## Step 4: Configure Hermes Agent

### Option A: Interactive Setup (Recommended)

Run the guided setup command:

```bash
hermes gateway setup
```

Select **Matrix** when prompted, then provide your homeserver URL, access token (or user ID + password), and allowed user IDs when asked.

### Option B: Manual Configuration

Add the following to your `~/.hermes/.env` file:

**Using an access token:**

```bash
# Required
MATRIX_HOMESERVER=https://matrix.example.org
MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN=***

# Optional: user ID (auto-detected from token if omitted)
# MATRIX_USER_ID=@hermes:matrix.example.org

# Security: restrict who can interact with the bot
MATRIX_ALLOWED_USERS=@alice:matrix.example.org

# Multiple allowed users (comma-separated)
# MATRIX_ALLOWED_USERS=@alice:matrix.example.org,@bob:matrix.example.org
```

**Using password login:**

```bash
# Required
MATRIX_HOMESERVER=https://matrix.example.org
MATRIX_USER_ID=@hermes:matrix.example.org
MATRIX_PASSWORD=***

# Security
MATRIX_ALLOWED_USERS=@alice:matrix.example.org
```

Optional behavior settings in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
group_sessions_per_user: true
```

- `group_sessions_per_user: true` keeps each participant's context isolated inside shared rooms

### Start the Gateway

Once configured, start the Matrix gateway:

```bash
hermes gateway
```

The bot should connect to your homeserver and start syncing within a few seconds. Send it a message — either a DM or in a room it has joined — to test.

:::tip
You can run `hermes gateway` in the background or as a systemd service for persistent operation. See the deployment docs for details.
:::

## End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)

Hermes supports Matrix end-to-end encryption, so you can chat with your bot in encrypted rooms.

### Requirements

E2EE requires the `matrix-nio` library with encryption extras and the `libolm` C library:

```bash
# Install matrix-nio with E2EE support
pip install 'matrix-nio[e2e]'

# Or install with hermes extras
pip install 'hermes-agent[matrix]'
```

You also need `libolm` installed on your system:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install libolm-dev

# macOS
brew install libolm

# Fedora
sudo dnf install libolm-devel
```

### Enable E2EE

Add to your `~/.hermes/.env`:

```bash
MATRIX_ENCRYPTION=true
```

When E2EE is enabled, Hermes:

- Stores encryption keys in `~/.hermes/platforms/matrix/store/` (legacy installs: `~/.hermes/matrix/store/`)
- Uploads device keys on first connection
- Decrypts incoming messages and encrypts outgoing messages automatically
- Auto-joins encrypted rooms when invited

:::warning
If you delete the `~/.hermes/platforms/matrix/store/` directory, the bot loses its encryption keys. You'll need to verify the device again in your Matrix client. Back up this directory if you want to preserve encrypted sessions.
:::

:::info
If `matrix-nio[e2e]` is not installed or `libolm` is missing, the bot falls back to a plain (unencrypted) client automatically. You'll see a warning in the logs.
:::

## Home Room

You can designate a "home room" where the bot sends proactive messages (such as cron job output, reminders, and notifications). There are two ways to set it:

### Using the Slash Command

Type `/sethome` in any Matrix room where the bot is present. That room becomes the home room.

### Manual Configuration

Add this to your `~/.hermes/.env`:

```bash
MATRIX_HOME_ROOM=!abc123def456:matrix.example.org
```

:::tip
To find a Room ID: in Element, go to the room → **Settings** → **Advanced** → the **Internal room ID** is shown there (starts with `!`).
:::

## Troubleshooting

### Bot is not responding to messages

**Cause**: The bot hasn't joined the room, or `MATRIX_ALLOWED_USERS` doesn't include your User ID.

**Fix**: Invite the bot to the room — it auto-joins on invite. Verify your User ID is in `MATRIX_ALLOWED_USERS` (use the full `@user:server` format). Restart the gateway.

### "Failed to authenticate" / "whoami failed" on startup

**Cause**: The access token or homeserver URL is incorrect.

**Fix**: Verify `MATRIX_HOMESERVER` points to your homeserver (include `https://`, no trailing slash). Check that `MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN` is valid — try it with curl:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://your-server/_matrix/client/v3/account/whoami
```

If this returns your user info, the token is valid. If it returns an error, generate a new token.

### "matrix-nio not installed" error

**Cause**: The `matrix-nio` Python package is not installed.

**Fix**: Install it:

```bash
pip install 'matrix-nio[e2e]'
```

Or with Hermes extras:

```bash
pip install 'hermes-agent[matrix]'
```

### Encryption errors / "could not decrypt event"

**Cause**: Missing encryption keys, `libolm` not installed, or the bot's device isn't trusted.

**Fix**:
1. Verify `libolm` is installed on your system (see the E2EE section above).
2. Make sure `MATRIX_ENCRYPTION=true` is set in your `.env`.
3. In your Matrix client (Element), go to the bot's profile → **Sessions** → verify/trust the bot's device.
4. If the bot just joined an encrypted room, it can only decrypt messages sent *after* it joined. Older messages are inaccessible.

### Sync issues / bot falls behind

**Cause**: Long-running tool executions can delay the sync loop, or the homeserver is slow.

**Fix**: The sync loop automatically retries every 5 seconds on error. Check the Hermes logs for sync-related warnings. If the bot consistently falls behind, ensure your homeserver has adequate resources.

### Bot is offline

**Cause**: The Hermes gateway isn't running, or it failed to connect.

**Fix**: Check that `hermes gateway` is running. Look at the terminal output for error messages. Common issues: wrong homeserver URL, expired access token, homeserver unreachable.

### "User not allowed" / Bot ignores you

**Cause**: Your User ID isn't in `MATRIX_ALLOWED_USERS`.

**Fix**: Add your User ID to `MATRIX_ALLOWED_USERS` in `~/.hermes/.env` and restart the gateway. Use the full `@user:server` format.

## Security

:::warning
Always set `MATRIX_ALLOWED_USERS` to restrict who can interact with the bot. Without it, the gateway denies all users by default as a safety measure. Only add User IDs of people you trust — authorized users have full access to the agent's capabilities, including tool use and system access.
:::

For more information on securing your Hermes Agent deployment, see the [Security Guide](/user-guide/security).

## Notes

- **Any homeserver**: Works with Synapse, Conduit, Dendrite, matrix.org, or any spec-compliant Matrix homeserver. No specific homeserver software required.
- **Federation**: If you're on a federated homeserver, the bot can communicate with users from other servers — just add their full `@user:server` IDs to `MATRIX_ALLOWED_USERS`.
- **Auto-join**: The bot automatically accepts room invites and joins. It starts responding immediately after joining.
- **Media support**: Hermes can send and receive images, audio, video, and file attachments. Media is uploaded to your homeserver using the Matrix content repository API.
- **Native voice messages (MSC3245)**: The Matrix adapter automatically tags outgoing voice messages with the `org.matrix.msc3245.voice` flag. This means TTS responses and voice audio are rendered as **native voice bubbles** in Element and other clients that support MSC3245, rather than as generic audio file attachments. Incoming voice messages with the MSC3245 flag are also correctly identified and routed to speech-to-text transcription. No configuration is needed — this works automatically.
