# BlueBubbles (iMessage)

Connect Hermes to Apple iMessage via [BlueBubbles](https://bluebubbles.app/) — a free, open-source macOS server that bridges iMessage to any device.

## Prerequisites

- A **Mac** (always on) running [BlueBubbles Server](https://bluebubbles.app/)
- Apple ID signed into Messages.app on that Mac
- BlueBubbles Server v1.0.0+ (webhooks require this version)
- Network connectivity between Hermes and the BlueBubbles server

## Setup

### 1. Install BlueBubbles Server

Download and install from [bluebubbles.app](https://bluebubbles.app/). Complete the setup wizard — sign in with your Apple ID and configure a connection method (local network, Ngrok, Cloudflare, or Dynamic DNS).

### 2. Get your Server URL and Password

In BlueBubbles Server → **Settings → API**, note:
- **Server URL** (e.g., `http://192.168.1.10:1234`)
- **Server Password**

### 3. Configure Hermes

Run the setup wizard:

```bash
hermes gateway setup
```

Select **BlueBubbles (iMessage)** and enter your server URL and password.

Or set environment variables directly in `~/.hermes/.env`:

```bash
BLUEBUBBLES_SERVER_URL=http://192.168.1.10:1234
BLUEBUBBLES_PASSWORD=your-server-password
```

### 4. Authorize Users

Choose one approach:

**DM Pairing (recommended):**
```bash
hermes pairing generate bluebubbles
```
Share the pairing code — the user sends it via iMessage to get approved.

**Pre-authorize specific users:**
```bash
BLUEBUBBLES_ALLOWED_USERS=user@icloud.com,+15551234567
```

**Open access:**
```bash
BLUEBUBBLES_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true
```

### 5. Start the Gateway

```bash
hermes gateway run
```

Hermes will connect to your BlueBubbles server, register a webhook, and start listening for iMessage messages.

## How It Works

```
iMessage → Messages.app → BlueBubbles Server → Webhook → Hermes
Hermes → BlueBubbles REST API → Messages.app → iMessage
```

- **Inbound:** BlueBubbles sends webhook events to a local listener when new messages arrive. No polling — instant delivery.
- **Outbound:** Hermes sends messages via the BlueBubbles REST API.
- **Media:** Images, voice messages, videos, and documents are supported in both directions. Inbound attachments are downloaded and cached locally for the agent to process.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `BLUEBUBBLES_SERVER_URL` | Yes | — | BlueBubbles server URL |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_PASSWORD` | Yes | — | Server password |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_WEBHOOK_HOST` | No | `127.0.0.1` | Webhook listener bind address |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_WEBHOOK_PORT` | No | `8645` | Webhook listener port |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_WEBHOOK_PATH` | No | `/bluebubbles-webhook` | Webhook URL path |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_HOME_CHANNEL` | No | — | Phone/email for cron delivery |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_ALLOWED_USERS` | No | — | Comma-separated authorized users |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` | No | `false` | Allow all users |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_SEND_READ_RECEIPTS` | No | `true` | Auto-mark messages as read |

## Features

### Text Messaging
Send and receive iMessages. Markdown is automatically stripped for clean plain-text delivery.

### Rich Media
- **Images:** Photos appear natively in the iMessage conversation
- **Voice messages:** Audio files sent as iMessage voice messages
- **Videos:** Video attachments
- **Documents:** Files sent as iMessage attachments

### Tapback Reactions
Love, like, dislike, laugh, emphasize, and question reactions. Requires the BlueBubbles [Private API helper](https://docs.bluebubbles.app/helper-bundle/installation).

### Typing Indicators
Shows "typing..." in the iMessage conversation while the agent is processing. Requires Private API.

### Read Receipts
Automatically marks messages as read after processing. Requires Private API.

### Chat Addressing
You can address chats by email or phone number — Hermes resolves them to BlueBubbles chat GUIDs automatically. No need to use raw GUID format.

## Private API

Some features require the BlueBubbles [Private API helper](https://docs.bluebubbles.app/helper-bundle/installation):
- Tapback reactions
- Typing indicators
- Read receipts
- Creating new chats by address

Without the Private API, basic text messaging and media still work.

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot reach server"
- Verify the server URL is correct and the Mac is on
- Check that BlueBubbles Server is running
- Ensure network connectivity (firewall, port forwarding)

### Messages not arriving
- Check that the webhook is registered in BlueBubbles Server → Settings → API → Webhooks
- Verify the webhook URL is reachable from the Mac
- Check `hermes gateway logs` for webhook errors

### "Private API helper not connected"
- Install the Private API helper: [docs.bluebubbles.app](https://docs.bluebubbles.app/helper-bundle/installation)
- Basic messaging works without it — only reactions, typing, and read receipts require it
