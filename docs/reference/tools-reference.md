# Built-in Tools Reference

This page documents all 47 built-in tools in the Hermes tool registry, grouped by toolset. Availability varies by platform, credentials, and enabled toolsets.

**Quick counts:** 10 browser tools, 4 file tools, 10 RL tools, 4 Home Assistant tools, 2 terminal tools, 2 web tools, and 15 standalone tools across other toolsets.

MCP Tools
In addition to built-in tools, Hermes can load tools dynamically from MCP servers. MCP tools appear with a server-name prefix (e.g., `github_create_issue` for the `github` MCP server). See [MCP Integration](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/mcp) for configuration.
